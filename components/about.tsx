        After a near-fatal car accident that left me paralyzed from the chest down at the age of 18, my academic
        career has been nothing but unconventional. I've embraced resilience and determination, refusing to be

        through my experiences and abilities as a student in a wheelchair.

        Working in research groups and receiving research grants for developing accessibility-related technology
